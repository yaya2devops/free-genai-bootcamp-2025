    Let me help translate this spiritual thought. Here's the vocabulary:

    | Hindi | Transliteration | English | Spiritual Context |
    |-------|----------------|----------|-------------------|
    |       | marg          | path     | journey of soul   |
    |       | gyan          | wisdom   | divine knowledge  |
    |       | shanti        | silence  | inner peace       |
    |       | andar         | within   | self-realization |

    Remember to use है at the end and में for location.
    Structure would be:
    [Subject] [Location] [Object] [है]

    Try creating the sentence using these words!
