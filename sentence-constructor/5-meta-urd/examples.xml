    Let me help you translate this manifestation concept. Here's the vocabulary:

    | Urdu | Roman | English | Context |
    |------|-------|----------|---------|
    |      | soch  | thought  | seed    |
    |      | cheez | thing    | form    |
    |      | dhyan | focus    | energy  |
    |      | banna | become   | transform|

    Remember to use ہے at the end and جب for when.
    Structure would be:
    [Subject] [Object] [Ban jata] [hai]

    Try creating the sentence using these words!
