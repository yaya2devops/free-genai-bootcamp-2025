    Let me help you translate this to Chinese. Here's the vocabulary:

    | Chinese | Pinyin | English |
    |---------|---------|----------|
    |         | xióng   | bear    |
    |         | mén     | door    |
    |         | lājī    | garbage |
    |         | liú     | leave   |

    For location, we use 在 (zài), and questions use 吗 (ma).
    Structure would be:
    [Subject] [在] [Location], [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [吗]?

    Try creating the sentence using these words!

    | Characters | Pinyin    | English  |
    |------------|-----------|----------|
    | 熊         | xióng    | bear     |
    | 门         | mén      | door     |
    | 垃圾       | lājī     | garbage  |
    | 留         | liú      | to leave |
    | 在         | zài      | at/in    |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Action], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - Location expression
    - Question formation
    - Past action
    - Connecting ideas

    Next Steps:
    - Try the location phrase
    - Form the question
    - Connect the parts
