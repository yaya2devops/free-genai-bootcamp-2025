### Model Selection Considerations
1. GPT-4 Standard:
   - Full capability model
   - Slower response time
   - More complex interpretations
   - Sometimes overcomplicates simple tasks

2. GPT-4 Mini:
   - Faster responses
   - Simpler interpretations
   - More direct implementations
   - Sometimes better for constrained tasks

3. Model Choice Rationale:
   - Selected GPT-4 standard initially
   - Performance comparison showed simpler models sometimes more effective
   - Speed vs. capability trade-off considerations

## Implementation Process

### Initial Prompt Testing
1. Base Structure Transfer:
   - Reused Meta AI prompt structure
   - Maintained core components:
     - Role definition
     - Language level specification
     - Teaching instructions
     - Example formats

2. Initial Observations:
   - Model provided particle information despite restrictions
   - Duplicated vocabulary entries
   - Mixed language level complexity
   - Inconsistent structure adherence

### Prompt Refinement

#### Formatting Instructions
```markdown
The formatted output will contain three parts:
1. Vocabulary Table
2. Sentence Structure
3. Clues and Considerations
```

#### Table Structure Requirements:
| Component | Specification | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Japanese | Character representation | Primary learning |
| Romaji | Phonetic guidance | Pronunciation help |
| English | Meaning | Understanding |

### Model Behavior Analysis

1. Vocabulary Handling:
   - Multiple word variants (e.g., karasu vs tori)
   - Dictionary form consistency
   - Duplicate entry issues
   - Complexity level adherence

2. Sentence Structure:
   - Time/location placement variations
   - Particle inclusion despite restrictions
   - Tense indication problems
   - Level-appropriate constructions

## Key Discoveries
