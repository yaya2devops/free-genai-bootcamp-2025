LibreChat is an open-source, self-hostable chatbot interface that allows users to interact with AI models like GPT and Claude. It provides a free, privacy-friendly alternative to proprietary AI chat applications by enabling users to deploy and control their own AI-powered chatbots.

### **Key Differences 
1. **Self-Hosting & Privacy** – Unlike OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude, LibreChat allows users to host the chatbot on their own servers, ensuring full control over data and privacy.  
2. **Multiple AI Models** – LibreChat can connect to various AI models, including OpenAI’s GPT, Claude, and even local models, giving users more flexibility.  
3. **Customization** – Users can modify the UI, integrate APIs, and adjust behavior according to their needs, unlike proprietary AI platforms.  
4. **Free & Open Source** – While GPT and Claude require subscriptions or API access, LibreChat is open-source, allowing anyone to deploy it without recurring fees.  
5. **No Vendor Lock-In** – Users aren’t restricted to a single provider, whereas ChatGPT and Claude are controlled by OpenAI and Anthropic, respectively.
