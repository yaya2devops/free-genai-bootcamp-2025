    In Tunisian Arabic, we put time expressions at the beginning. For "want", we use "n7eb". 
    Let's look at the vocabulary:

    | Tunisian | Phonetic | English |
    |----------|----------|----------|
    |          | n7eb     | want    |
    |          | souk     | market  |
    |          | ghodwa   | tomorrow|
    |          | sba7     | morning |

    The structure in Tunisian is:
    [Time] [Subject] [Want] [Verb] [Location] 

    Remember to use "lel" before souk for "to the"!
