Backend — Lang Portal

Difficulty: Level 200

Business Goal: 
A language learning school wants to build a prototype of learning portal which will act as three things:
Inventory of possible vocabulary that can be learned
Act as a  Learning record store (LRS), providing correct and wrong score on practice vocabulary
A unified launchpad to launch different learning apps

You have been tasked with creating the backend API of the application.

Technical Restrictions:
Use SQLite3 as the database
You can use any language or framework 
Does not require authentication/authorization, assume there is a single user

Leverage AI-coding assistants to write your backend code:
Cursor
Windsurf Codeium
Github Copilot
Amazon Q Developer
Google Code Assist

Routes

GET /words - Get paginated list of words with review statistics
GET /groups - Get paginated list of word groups with word counts
GET /groups/:id - Get words from a specific group (This is intended to be used by target apps)
POST /study_sessions - Create a new study session for a group
POST /study_sessions/:id/review - Log a review attempt for a word during a study session

GET /words
page: Page number (default: 1)
sort_by: Sort field ('kanji', 'romaji', 'english', 'correct_count', 'wrong_count') (default: 'kanji')
order: Sort order ('asc' or 'desc') (default: 'asc')

GET /groups/:id
page: Page number (default: 1)
sort_by: Sort field ('name', 'words_count') (default: 'name')
order: Sort order ('asc' or 'desc') (default: 'asc')

POST /study_sessions
group_id: ID of the group to study (required)
study_activity_id: ID of the study activity (required)


POST /study_sessions/:id/review

Database Schema 





words — Stores individual Japanese vocabulary words.
- `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each word
- `kanji` (String, Required): The word written in Japanese kanji
- `romaji` (String, Required): Romanized version of the word
- `english` (String, Required): English translation of the word
- `parts` (JSON, Required): Word components stored in JSON format

groups — Manages collections of words.
- `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each group
- `name` (String, Required): Name of the group
- `words_count` (Integer, Default: 0): Counter cache for the number of words in the group

word_groups — join-table enabling many-to-many relationship between words and groups.
- `word_id` (Foreign Key): References words.id
- `group_id` (Foreign Key): References groups.id

study_activities — Defines different types of study activities available.
- `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each activity
- `name` (String, Required): Name of the activity (e.g., "Flashcards", "Quiz")
- `url` (String, Required): The full URL of the study activity

study_sessions — Records individual study sessions.
- `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each session
- `group_id` (Foreign Key): References groups.id
- `study_activity_id` (Foreign Key): References study_activities.id
- `created_at` (Timestamp, Default: Current Time): When the session was created

word_review_items — Tracks individual word reviews within study sessions.
- `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each review
- `word_id` (Foreign Key): References words.id
- `study_session_id` (Foreign Key): References study_sessions.id
- `correct` (Boolean, Required): Whether the answer was correct
- `created_at` (Timestamp, Default: Current Time): When the review occurred

Relationships

word belongs to groups through  word_groups
group belongs to words through word_groups
session belongs to a group
session belongs to a study_activity
session has many word_review_items
word_review_item belongs to a study_session
word_review_item belongs to a word

Design Notes
All tables use auto-incrementing primary keys
Timestamps are automatically set on creation where applicable
Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
JSON storage for word parts allows flexible component storage
Counter cache on groups.words_count optimizes word counting queries

Home Challenge
Level 1: reimpement the missing API endpoints
Level 5: rebuild the entire thing from scratch with whatever you want.
