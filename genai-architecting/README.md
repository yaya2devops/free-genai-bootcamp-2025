# Practical Gen AI Architecture Guide

The Gen AI architectural approach should be tailored to match your project's scope and requirements. While enterprise solutions may require complex implementations with multiple safeguards and integrations, smaller projects can start with simpler architectures and evolve as needed. This guide focuses on practical implementation while maintaining awareness of enterprise-level considerations.

We'll kick-start this with the following conceptual diagram I created and give you the space to take it forward. 


It was generated when I asked LLM to create it for me in mermaid using this prompt:

```
Design a high-level GenAI architecture to help stakeholders understand workloads, technical paths, and adoption challenges. The architecture consists of key components: Data Strategy, ensuring data collection, preprocessing, privacy, and compliance; Model Selection, deciding between open-source vs. proprietary, SaaS vs. self-hosted, optimizing for efficiency and scalability; Infrastructure, leveraging cloud, on-premise, or hybrid setups with modular, flexible design for adaptability; Integration & Deployment, developing APIs, middleware, and CI/CD pipelines for seamless connectivity and updates; Security & Governance, enforcing access control, encryption, compliance, and ethical AI policies; and Business Considerations, addressing complexity, cost drivers (compute, storage, API calls), scalability, and vendor lock-in risks. This architecture provides a structured approach to informed decision-making, guiding stakeholders through infrastructure choices and system dependencies.

You'll also learn why this is the best diagram to start with. 

Let us get it going!


## Core Architecture Components

   - Geographic distribution
   - Bandwidth requirements
   - Processing capabilities

2. Model Selection Criteria:
   ```
   Priority Factors:
   - Open source availability
   - Training data transparency

   ```

### Data Management Strategy

#### Storage Considerations
1. Content Management:
   - Purchased materials

The implementation doesn't need to be overwhelmingly complex to be effective. While enterprise solutions may require comprehensive security measures, multiple integrations, and complex orchestration patterns, many practical implementations can start with a focused set of core components: a reliable model integration, basic security measures, essential data management, and targeted performance optimization.
