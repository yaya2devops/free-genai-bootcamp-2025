Once the above are established, you can move ahead with architecting using GenAI.

[Here](../genai-architecting/README.md), you will find a good introduction to the process.

Under this, you will find the legacy architecture provided for:

- **[JP GenAI](../genai-architecting/legacy/JP/JP%20Architectural%20Diagramming%20-%20Lang%20Portal.svg)**
- **[A GenAI roadmap](../genai-architecting/legacy/roadmap/GenAI-Roadmap.svg)**

You will also find the conceptual design I created for this bootcamp, which is available on the main page or as a standalone resource.

Additionally, legacy architectures are provided in three formats: **Visio, VisioX, and SVG**, all of which can be accessed through the links above.
