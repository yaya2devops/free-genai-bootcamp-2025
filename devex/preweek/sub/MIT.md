  - `sentence_constructor`
- Ensure correct folder structure

### Technical Documentation Components

#### 1. Hypothesis Documentation
Example format:
```markdown
Initial Assumptions:
- Meta AI capability limitations
- Paid tier requirements
- Platform performance expectations
```

#### 2. Technical Uncertainty
Exploration areas:
- Model capabilities
- Platform limitations

#### 4. Final Outcomes
Documentation format:
```markdown
Key Findings:
1. Model Performance:
   - Meta AI: 70B parameter model, exceeded expectations
   - ChatGPT: Adequate but verbose
   - Claude: Best output, higher cost

2. Implementation Insights:
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Prompt optimization
   - Resource utilization
```

## Example Documentation

### Hypothesis Example
```markdown
Initial Assumptions:
1. Model Capabilities:
   - Meta AI insufficient for complex tasks
   - Paid tiers required for optimal performance
   - Claude expected to provide best results

2. Implementation Requirements:
   - Platform-specific optimizations needed
   - Resource usage considerations
   - Performance variations expected
```

### Technical Exploration Example
```markdown
Development Process:
1. Platform Testing:
   - Meta AI: GPT-4, 70B parameters
   - ChatGPT: GPT-4, Paid tier
   - Claude: Sonnet 3.5, Paid version

2. Implementation Steps:
   - Incremental prompt development
   - Cross-platform testing
   - Performance optimization
```

### Final Outcomes Example
```markdown
Key Findings:
1. Performance Analysis:
   - Meta AI: Surprisingly effective, 70B parameter model
   - ChatGPT Mini: Limited effectiveness
   - GPT-4: Good but verbose
   - Claude: Optimal output, higher cost

2. Implementation Insights:
   - Common prompt structure effective
   - Claude-specific optimizations beneficial
   - Resource monitoring crucial
```
